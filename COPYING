SAMS Copying and Distribution
================================

SAMS is Open Source software with copyright primarily held by the
New BSD Licence.  The source code is controlled and maintained by a
core team of Open Source developers current students of the University of Buea.
Those core developers operate under a meritocracy organizational structure
adhering to developer guidelines outlined in the HACKING developer's
guide and to the legal conventions and requirements outlined in this
document.

As a unified work, SAMS is made available under the terms of the
BSD New Licence also known as BSD-3 Licence as published by the BSD Software Foundation.

As distinctly organized and separate components, parts of BRL-CAD are
made available under different licenses for different portions
including the BSD license and files in the public domain. The Overview
section describes how the various licenses apply to the different
portions of BRL-CAD.
